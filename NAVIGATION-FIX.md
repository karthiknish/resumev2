# Navigation Overlap Fix

This document provides instructions for fixing navigation overlap issues across the site.

## The Problem

The navigation bar was hiding content on some pages because:
1. The navigation was fixed with `fixed w-full z-50` and positioned with `mt-10`
2. Most pages had content starting with `min-h-screen` and `p-8` but didn't have enough padding at the top to account for the fixed navigation

## The Solution

We've implemented several fixes:

1. **Updated the navigation component**:
   - Removed `mt-10` and added `top-0 left-0 right-0`
   - Increased z-index to `z-[100]`
   - Added consistent padding with `py-4`
   - Improved background opacity for better readability

2. **Added global CSS classes**:
   - Added `.page-content` with `padding-top: 6rem` to ensure content doesn't get hidden
   - Added `.nav-padding` as a utility class for spacing

3. **Created a reusable `PageContainer` component**:
   - This component handles proper spacing and background effects
   - It's been applied to the blog detail and index pages

## How to Update Remaining Pages

To update the remaining pages, follow these steps for each page:

1. **Import the PageContainer component**:
   ```javascript
   import PageContainer from "@/components/PageContainer";
   ```

2. **Replace the existing container structure**:

   From:
   ```jsx
   <div className="min-h-screen bg-black/95 p-8 relative">
     <BackgroundBeamsWithCollision className="absolute inset-0 -z-10" />
     <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto space-y-8">
       {/* Content */}
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

   To:
   ```jsx
   <PageContainer className="space-y-8">
     {/* Content */}
   </PageContainer>
   ```

3. **Adjust content padding if needed**:
   - The PageContainer already includes `p-8` padding
   - If your content had specific padding, you can pass it via the `className` prop

## Example Pages Already Updated

- `src/pages/blog/[id].js`
- `src/pages/blog/index.js`

## Testing

After updating each page, test it to ensure:
1. The navigation doesn't hide any content
2. The page looks consistent with the rest of the site
3. The spacing feels natural and not excessive

## Additional Notes

- The `PageContainer` component supports customization via props:
  - `withBeams`: Whether to include background beams (default: true)
  - `className`: Additional classes for the content container
  - `bgClassName`: Additional classes for the background container
